Welcome to my first currency converter, which I created as homework in the YOUCODE course.

## What does it allow?

This currency converter allows you to convert the amount of money in the zloty currency to other currencies such as the US dollar, British pound and euro. In this case, the exchange rates of individual currencies have been assigned to a given currency as a fixed value.
## How does the currency converter work?

In the currency converter form, enter the amount in the zloty currency that you want to convert (in the "Kwota w zl" field). Then select the currency in which you want to get the amount of money after conversion (in the "Waluta" field) and click the "Recalculate" button (in the "Przelicz" field). The form will return the value entered in PLN and the corresponding value in the currency to which the amount was to be converted. If a negative value is entered, the form will return a message that negative amounts cannot be converted.
